== Description ==

A widget that helps to display recruitment message of a World of Warcraft guild.
It works just fine out of the box, but it is very customizable with some CSS techniques.
[Customization tutorial can be found here](http://www.ycfreeman.com/2010/08/wow-recruitment-wordpress-widget.html)

* please save the widget once after upgrade from 1.0.x to make it work with new codes, 
* make sure you backup those color codes before upgrade if you have changed them before 1.2

New Features in 1.3:
* Customizable tooltip! opens up even more layout possibilities
* Bug report icon which links to the latest blog post of current version
* Able to display "Closed" status! (not in a very smart way, so be careful while using it)

To use this widget, simply go to Appearance => Widget and drag it to a sidebar as similar to other widgets.
